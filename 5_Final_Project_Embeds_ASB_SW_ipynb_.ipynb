He first became interested in his major field, genetics, in the house of the geneticist Adriano Buzzati at Belluno, in the hills north of Venice. There he helped to collect thousands of flies in search of mutant Y chromosomes; and though he subsequently travelled the world to study the makeup of its tribes and populations, it was in Belluno that he died.He had vaguely meant to be a doctor, but found his training useless in wartime hospitals. Instead, he took up the genetic study of E. coli bacteria, shutting himself away in the laboratory. But human beings still fascinated him: not least because he increasingly realised that the human genome contained not only the instructions for building future members of the species, but also its entire past. Migration, conquest and isolation had also left their traces in living populations. He set out to find them.The technology available was rudimentary. He pored over names in parish registers and learned to do statistics, convinced that with enough patience he could measure anything. For one early paper he pulled surnames from Italian phone directories as proxies for father-son transmission. By plotting the distribution of names in 91 provinces, he showed that the Apennines\\u2014the backbone of Italy\\u2014had formed a natural barrier to migration for millennia, resulting in genetically distinct populations on either side. And because he could also measure variation in blood proteins, such as that between A, B and O blood types, he also collected blood samples from townsfolk all over the Parma valley to show that marriage between related individuals had led to many of the genetic differences between those towns.For two decades from 1970, when he took up a professorship at Stanford, he devoted himself to this subject. By the 1990s he was able to study variation in DNA itself. When he and his colleagues instructed a computer to sort around 1,000 people from across the globe into five clusters by similarity of DNA, the clusters matched the labels by which humans had long grouped themselves intuitively: West Eurasians, East Asians, Native Americans, New Guineans and Africans. He soon concluded, though, that race was not a scientifically valid way to classify them. Europeans, for example, were about two-thirds Asian and one-third African, but after millennia of mixing there was no such thing as pure Asian or pure African either. Skin colour, or the shape of a nose, were just superficial adaptations to climate and place.He represented his genetic data as \\u201ctrees\\u201d branching over time: simplistic diagrams, but beautiful in their simplicity. They often agreed, as he had hoped, with the findings of linguists and archaeologists: suggesting, for example, that humanity arose in Africa, where it stayed for a long time before moving outwards, somewhere between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. The earliest African migrants probably reached Asia first, moving on to Oceania, Europe and America, in that order.He particularly liked to tell his story of farmers. By checking variations between individuals based on their blood groups, he discerned a gradient in that variation that stretched south-east-to-north-west across Europe. This he saw as the genetic signature of farming after its invention around 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent. As early farmers radiated out of the Near East, he argued, they bred with indigenous hunter-gatherers, until by the time they reached colder climates their genes were a good mix of both.This theory stood until the 2000s, when new technology reversed it. He had often carped about the public\\u2019s interest in fossils, so much less informative\\u2014to him\\u2014than genetic studies of the living. Once DNA could be extracted from ancient bones, however, it showed that although agriculture had indeed reached Europe from the Middle East, a wave of immigration from the north-east, starting about 5,000 years ago, had diluted those first farmers with tall herdsmen from the Pontic Steppe. People had moved and mixed in prehistory more than he thought; and not all ancient events, as he supposed, had left their mark in modern populations.Even more controversial was his Human Genome Diversity Project, which he set up in the 1990s. He wanted to study isolated populations in order to understand where all the others came from; to measure the background of drift, or genetic change, that takes place without marauding or migration. Some people thought this racist, and a more worldly man might have realised that. A few critics even brought up his membership of Benito Mussolini\\u2019s fascist youth organisation, compulsory before the war. All this dismayed him, as he had done so much to strike down \\u201cscientific\\u201d studies based on race. The project died in its original form, though it was resurrected as the Genographic Project, which goes on.From Belluno he witnessed the overturning of many other conclusions. Every evolutionary story he had touched became more complex by the day. Yet he could comfort himself that without his original vision for the study of human history through its genes, much of that great debate would not have happened at all.\",\n          \"T HE FIRST outbreak of a novel disease is the opening scene of a whodunnit. In 1976, when more than two dozen members of the American Legion died after a convention in Philadelphia, public-health officials spent months scouring the hotel they had met in before finally tracking down the culprit in the water tank on the roof: a new bacterium which, having caused the first known cases of Legionnaires\\u2019 disease, was named Legionella. In the 1980s it took years of hard work and acrimonious argument among epidemiologists and virologists to blame the terrible and varied symptoms of AIDS on HIV, a virus of a type never previously seen in humans.For covid-19, the mystery was solved almost as soon as it had begun. The novel pneumonia that doctors in Wuhan noticed in December 2019 immediately brought to mind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease caused by a coronavirus which broke out in 2002. As a result of SARS and the subsequent outbreak in 2012 of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also caused by a coronavirus, there were already established protocols for growing cells from the lining of the nose, throat and lungs in order to look for coronavirus infection. They were soon put to use.To identify the possible coronavirus responsible meant producing a sequence of its genome. The first step in this process was to extract RNA\\u2014the molecule on which coronavirus genomes are written\\u2014from the cell cultures. The genetic sequences in these RNA molecules then had to be transcribed into complementary bits of DNA, because that is what automated sequencing machines work with (see part A of diagram).Computer programs assembled the sequences those machines produced into a recognisable, if gappy, coronavirus genome. Researchers used this to make DNA \\u201cprimers\\u201d with which to fish out the not-yet-sequenced bits of the genome. Finished sequences were published less than two weeks after the process had begun. On January 12th 2020 the world knew its enemy\\u2014soon thereafter named SARS-CoV-2\\u2014down to the last letter of its genome.In terms of the science done, this was all routine; the appropriate use of standard laboratory techniques. In terms of its impact, it was enormous. Knowing the viral sequence was fundamental to vaccination efforts, made it possible to track the virus\\u2019s evolution and, most immediately, made it possible to test people with a cough and see if they were infected. The first AIDS tests were not available until four years after medical science became aware of the condition they tested for. For SARS it took six months. Procedures for testing swabs from the nose and throat for RNA from SARS-CoV-2 were published 11 days after the genome sequence, on January 23rd.There was, however, a drawback to the tests. They required suitably equipped laboratories. Most countries did not have nearly enough of the relevant lab capacity; in others, much of it was being used for different things. \\u201cPrior to March 23rd my lab had never performed a viral diagnostic,\\u201d says Stacey Gabriel, who runs genetic-sequencing operations at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But with public institutions swamped she and her colleagues created one of the largest testing shops on America\\u2019s east coast from scratch, reconfiguring the specialised robots that populate one of the world\\u2019s most advanced cancer-genetics labs to do the grunt work.Dr Gabriel learned two lessons in the process. The first is that uniformity matters a lot. The Broad started off testing samples from Massachusetts nursing homes which came in containers of varying size and with various amounts of liquid, some accompanied by handwritten forms, some by barcodes. Dealing with such messiness is no task for a robot, and so to begin with just a few thousand samples a day passed through machines capable of handling far more. The second is that you need software to track the whole process. Commercial software, dry swabs and barcoding soon had the lab firing on all cylinders. By March 2021 it could handle 200,000 tests a day and was serving customers as far afield as New York.The data such labs produce are not just for patients and doctors. In most countries covid-19 is a notifiable disease; the authorities have a legal right to know who has been found to be infected. When a sample tests positive the lab has to pass the identity of the person it came from on to public-health officials. At that point a new sort of detective work begins: where did that person\\u2014the index case, in public-health speak\\u2014pick up the virus? To whom might they have given it?Several East Asian countries demonstrated that, if started in the earliest days of an epidemic and pursued with vigour and persistence, such contact tracing can be a powerful tool. Some, such as Singapore and Taiwan, benefited in this from their experience with SARS in the mid-2000s; tracing systems set in place back then were put to use with an urgency born of experience. A level of invasiveness from which most Western authorities shied away was often employed. In South Korea, for instance, contact tracers were able to download a list of all financial transactions made by those who tested positive; they could then obtain CCTV footage from shops the index case had visited in search of other customers to check up on. \\u201c[Such snooping] has come up with discussions I\\u2019ve had with policymakers,\\u201d says Christophe Fraser, a digital epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. \\u201cWe got very hung up on the idea of contact tracing disrupting people\\u2019s lives.\\u201dWestern governments acted in a slower, less thoroughgoing way. They failed to track the initial spread, in part because of insufficient testing capacity (and, in America, dud tests from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention). They ended up with much less impressive systems. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, says he thinks that, at its current level of effort, America could plausibly trace about 15,000 cases a day\\u2014a level that has been handsomely exceeded every day since April 2nd 2020. Britain has earmarked \\u00a337bn for testing and tracing over the 2020 and 2021 financial years, and though it may well spend less, the shoddiness that has dogged some elements of the campaign, such as a database cock-up which lost thousands of results in September 2020, will be remembered.A basic problem is that contact tracing is a lot of work. Theoretical assessments based on analysing social networks and experience in Asia both suggest that some 30 contacts need to be identified for each index case. Digital tools can lessen the load. Resolve to Save Lives, a campaign run by Vital Strategies, an NGO, developed Locator, which taps into credit data to help tracers track down people who may have caught the virus from a specific index case. But the amount of work required remained enormous.A much discussed alternative to such programmes was to use the world\\u2019s most ubiquitous tracking devices: smartphones. Google and Apple worked together to develop a system which enabled phones to keep a list of occasions when they were near another phone for a significant period of time, and the identity of that second phone. When someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 they are asked to send a message from their phone which is used to notify all the other phones they had been near within a particular window of time. But everything is peer-to-peer; neither the big tech companies nor the public-health authorities get a list of contacts.Unfortunately this built-in privacy makes it hard to assess the technology\\u2019s efficacy. British and Swiss studies suggest such apps do reduce spread, but not enough to make them more than an also-ran technology. None of the successful contact-tracing systems in East Asia relies on such things to any significant extent.Even without good tracing, self isolation of those who tested positive helped slow the spread of the disease. But over time the shortcomings of the initial testing technology, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), became ever more apparent. It is conceptually elegant (see diagram) and easy for labs to use. But despite its familiarity, reliability and sensitivity, it has real disadvantages.One is that it needs labs, and is carried out most efficiently in big ones. This means samples may have to travel a long way. It also means that they can get held in queues. The Broad runs its RT-PCR tests in just three and a half hours; but the average sample takes 15 hours to process. Results from RT-PCR tests normally come in days not minutes.Another problem is that though the presence of viral RNA clearly shows that a person has been infected, it says very little about where they stand in the course of the disease; RNA is detectible from very soon after infection to long after the disease has run its course. In public-health terms what is needed is a test that spots people who are actually infectious\\u2014people with cells in their noses and throats actively churning out virus particles.To look for the SARS-CoV-2 particles themselves means looking for their distinctive protein components, not for the RNA that tells cells how to make them. The most detectible such component is the spike protein which studs the particles\\u2019 outer membranes. And one of the basic rules of modern biotechnology is that when you want to find a protein, use an antibody.Antibodies are large molecules that come in millions of varieties, each of which sticks to one target\\u2014known as that antibody\\u2019s \\u201cantigen\\u201d\\u2014and one target only. A handy technology called lateral-flow testing makes use of that specificity. A sample is placed at one end of a porous membrane and, as it seeps along to the other, encounters a line of antibodies designed to recognise it. When the sample is urine and the antigen is a hormone found in expectant women, you have a pregnancy test. When the sample is mucus from a swab and the antigen is the spike protein, it is a covid-19 test\\u2014a cheap, convenient one which can provide results with in half an hour. Such tests may not pick up all the people in whom RT-PCR might detect a trace of the virus. But if their nose and throat cells are not producing enough antigen for the test to detect, they are probably not producing enough to be infectious, either.At the beginning of the epidemic \\u201cthe supply chain for the lateral-flow tests wasn\\u2019t there,\\u201d says Dr Gabriel. Chris Hand, the chairman of Abingdon Health, a British contract manufacturer of lateral-flow tests, says the main bottleneck was the speciality membranes that are part of every test kit. \\u201cThey come on large reels of 100 metres plus, which go through automated equipment to add biochemicals by spraying them at low volumes,\\u201d he says. But once the biochemicals\\u2014the bespoke antibodies and some more generic bits and bobs\\u2014are ready, the production processes in place and the packaging sorted, the tests could be churned out by the million.New technologies now reaching the market will further change the dynamics of test and trace. QuantuMDx is one of a number of companies developing automated PCR-in-a-box systems that provide results within a couple of hours. Jonathan O\\u2019Halloran, the firm\\u2019s boss, says the British company has been relying on its own testing system for the past 22 weeks, testing its 90 staff members every morning (they are free to decline). About once a week lunchtime brings the news that someone has tested positive; they are immediately sent home to isolate. When things are done this fast, the fact that RNA is detectable before people are infectious is a plus; isolating on the basis of an early PCR test means no one ever turns up to work infectious. The company claims not to have lost a single day to infection.A combination of local, automated PCR and lateral-flow tests could be the basis of an ideal testing system\\u2014one which has a chance of keeping ahead of, and containing, a low level of disease rather than lagging behind one that is shooting up. Antigen tests would be used to scan the population for new infections. Those found would be referred to contact tracers; contacts who might have been infected could then be PCR-tested to find out which of them actually were.Great for public health. No benefit, in itself, to the index cases who would wait, isolated, to see what fate the virus and their immune systems had in store for them\\u2014painfully aware that their next encounter with the wonders of modern medical technology could be in a hospital bed. \\u25a0\",\n          \"FOR decades scientists have been trying to understand schizophrenia, a distressing disorder that afflicts one in a hundred people. Its destructive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, muddled thoughts and changes in behaviour. The best drugs offer little more than the ability to target symptoms. There is presently no hope of a cure because its ultimate cause has long been a mystery.Schizophrenia is known to run in families, so it has always been thought that genes might shed light on the origins of the disease. But the genetics have proved harder to unpick than anyone imagined. It is only now, 16 years after the human genome was first sequenced, that scientists have homed in on the relevant genes.For more than five years researchers led by a group at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, collected more than 100,000 DNA samples from around the world. They were looking for regions of the human genome that might be harbouring variants that increased the risk of schizophrenia. What they found implicated more than a hundred genes and provided a strong pointer towards a portion of the genome associated with infectious diseases. Many of these genes did not operate independently of each other, and further detective work revealed that the most important source of variation lay within a particular gene known as C4.Steven McCarroll, of Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues involved in the study, report in Nature this week that particular forms of the C4 gene led to a greater risk of developing schizophrenia. What makes C4 hard to identify is that it comes in many different forms and has an intriguing function. The gene produces a protein known as a complement factor, which helps to tag pathogens for removal by the body\\u2019s immune system. In the brain, however, it appears to be tied to a developmental process known as \\u201csynaptic pruning\\u201d, in which neurons are continuously eliminated throughout childhood and into early adulthood.In other words schizophrenics may be producing too much of a protein that creates a signal that synaptic connections should be removed. During late adolescence the brain undergoes widespread synaptic pruning, particularly in the cerebral cortex. This is also the age at which schizophrenia symptoms tend to begin.David Goldstein, director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia University, says he is persuaded by the research, but reckons it is important for the medical community to examine the study carefully because the region of the genome under discussion is hard to work on and is \\u201cstuffed full of genetic variation\\u201d. That makes it difficult to point to a single gene and say \\u201cit\\u2019s this\\u201d, he adds.As to whether those with a family history of schizophrenia ought to have their genome sequenced to assess their susceptibility, Dr Goldstein is keen to point out that more work needs to be done on the risks that different forms of the genes bring. Moreover, other factors can be implicated in developing schizophrenia, ranging from taking psychoactive drugs to being exposed to viruses while in the womb.Synaptic pruning is so crucial in brain development researchers wonder what other mental disorders might be tied to its aberrant activation or regulation. This study is bound to initiate a flurry of similar work. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, for one, has been tied to, among other things, excessive destruction of synapses. And it is already believed that autistic individuals have a surplus of synapses in the brain, due to a slowdown in normal brain pruning. Indeed, the onset of autism often follows a period when there is a burst of synapse formation. One big step forward in schizophrenia research could have an enormous impact on the way other neurological disorders are viewed and treated.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 962,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Genetic engineering may help control disease-carrying mosquitoes\",\n          \"Covid-19 has many faces\",\n          \"Studying broken chromosomes can illuminate neuroscience\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 783,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Aug 29th 2019\",\n          \" Aug 24th 2006\",\n          \" Jan 11th 2022\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 962,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/05/26/genetic-engineering-may-help-control-disease-carrying-mosquitoes\",\n          \"https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/05/09/covid-19-has-many-faces\",\n          \"https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/03/08/studying-broken-chromosomes-can-illuminate-neuroscience\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
